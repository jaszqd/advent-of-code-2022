Advent of Code 2022 Daily Challenges
This repository is simply a dump for my advent of code challenges.  Nothing too fancy here.

Naming conventions for files are "#_#.py" where the first number corresponds to the day of the challenge and the second number (1, 2) corresponds to either the first or the second half of the challenge.  For files where there is only "#_1.py", both challenges were included in the script and I'm too lazy to separate them.
